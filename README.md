# Points Tracker for "Summer of GNOME OS"

## Disclaimer
This was created in a couple hours as a joke, inspired by a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/1l0yzvo/comment/mvhtvq3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the GNOME subreddit. It is also my first extension, so don't be surprised if you encounter bugs!
