This was inspired by a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/1l0yzvo/comment/mvhtvq3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the GNOME subreddit:

> This is never gonna take off without a shell extension that displays the score.

## Installation
1. Download the latest [extension bundle](https://github.com/garhow/points-tracker/releases/download/v0.1.1/pointstracker@garhow.github.com.zip).
3. Open a terminal, locate the file and run `gnome-extensions install pointstracker@garhow.github.com.zip`.
4. Log out of your GNOME session and log back in.
5. Enable the extension by running `gnome-extensions enable pointstracker@garhow.github.com`.
6. Profit.

## Usage
Upon installation, the extension will default to an empty username.

Change this by clicking the indicator, and then the "Configure" button, and entering in the exact name that you used on the [HedgeDoc](https://pad.gnome.org/s/summer-of-gnomeos).

## Disclaimer
This is my first GNOME Shell extension, and it was created in just a few hours as a joke, so don't be surprised if you encounter bugs!
