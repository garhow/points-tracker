## Disclaimer
This was created in a couple hours as a joke, inspired by a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/1l0yzvo/comment/mvhtvq3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on the GNOME subreddit:

> This is never gonna take off without a shell extension that displays the score.

It is also my first GNOME Shell extension, so don't be surprised if you encounter bugs!
